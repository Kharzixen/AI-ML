## 2) Bayes Spam filter
### Project Overview
The Bayesian Spam Filter project aims to identify whether an email is spam or not using Bayesian probability theory. It combines both supervised and unsupervised training methods to improve accuracy in classifying emails. The project utilizes a dataset of labeled emails to train a supervised classifier and employs unsupervised techniques like Naive Bayes to enhance spam detection.
### Features
The project uses a labeled dataset of emails, which can be found in the `data` directory. Make sure to update the dataset with your own email data or obtain a suitable dataset for further training and testing.
### Supervised and Unsupervised Training
The supervised classifier is trained using labeled data to learn patterns and features that distinguish spam from non-spam emails. It is essential to have a well-labeled dataset for effective supervised training.

The unsupervised Bayesian filter leverages Bayesian probability and Naive Bayes techniques to classify emails without relying on labeled data. It calculates the likelihood of an email being spam or ham based on learned probabilities from the training data.
